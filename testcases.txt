Phase 3 write up at bottom
test cases
[start of phase 2]
[chain formation]
configuration files used: config1.txt, config2.txt

1. Master is spawned reads the configuration file about banks and servers.  
	Master prints start message
2. Server processes are spawned and reads configuration file
	server processes register with master.
3. First registering server becomes stand alone. 
	master when receives first tail registration, makes the server stand alone
4. Further servers from same bank register as tail one by one
	First server is promoted to head, and latest joined server becomes tail
5. When a server for a bank joins as tail, current tail tail becomes intermediate server

[Operations]

1.  Operations generated as user given commands in txt file
	configuration file used: config2.txt
	i). client 1 of bank 1 sends getBalance for account 3333
		expected: outcome. illegal
		result:  outcome.illegal
	ii). client 1 of bank 1 send deposit of 100 for account 3333
		expected: outcome.processed, balance 100
		result: outcome.processed, balance 100
	iii). Client 1 of bank 1 send withdraw of 50 for account 3333
		expected: outcome.processed, balance 50
		result: outcome.processed, balance 50
	iv). client 2 of bank 1 send deposit of 100 for account 7777
		expected: outcome.processed, balance 100
		result: outcome.processed, balance 100
	v). client 2 of bank 1 send withdraw of 150 for account 7777
		expected: outcome.insuf_fund, balance 100
		result: outcome.insuf_fund, balance 100
2. Operations generated as probabilities of operations. 
	configuration file used: config1.txt

	1. clients generate account numbers using a random number. 
	2. based on probability of operation, client use a random number generator decide what operation to perform and the amount is generated in a range. 
	number of test cases for each client: 15
	expected result: outcome.processed, outcome.insuf_fund, outcome.illegal should be present in log 
	result: outcome.processed, outcome.insuf_fund, outcome.illegal are present
[end of phase 2]
